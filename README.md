## Notes on the build
Built using jquery-3.2.1min.js and using AJAX to incorporating the API from http://ergast.com/mrd/.  

## Key learning

* Creating a Web App from Scratch.
* Querying The API for information about the circuits.
* using JQuery AJAX function.
* Using JQuery "each" function to iterate through the API.
* The function(show) function is a call back to display the information we are getting.

## What went well
* Must get the correct call to the json data.
* Learning using different function (Ajax in JQuery) to access an API .
